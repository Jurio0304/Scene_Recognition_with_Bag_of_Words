def svm_classify(train_image_feats, train_labels, test_image_feats):
    '''
    This function will predict a category for every test image by training
    15 many-versus-one linear SVM classifiers on the training data, then
    using those learned classifiers on the testing data.

    Inputs:
        train_image_feats: An nxd numpy array, where n is the number of training
                           examples, and d is the image descriptor vector size.
        train_labels: An nx1 Python list containing the corresponding ground
                      truth labels for the training data.
        test_image_feats: An mxd numpy array, where m is the number of test
                          images and d is the image descriptor vector size.

    Outputs:
        An mx1 numpy array of strings, where each string is the predicted label
        for the corresponding image in test_image_feats

    We suggest you look at the sklearn.svm module, including the LinearSVC
    class. With the right arguments, you can get a 15-class SVM as described
    above in just one call! Be sure to read the documentation carefully.
